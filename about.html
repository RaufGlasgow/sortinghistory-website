        <section id="story">
            <p>I'm a television producer, not a game developer.</p>

            <p>My family loves playing games together — all kinds of games. My wife's favorite has always been Chronology. We've been playing it for ten years.</p>

            <p>One day she said to me, "Some of these facts are getting old. I wish there was a way to play a sorting history game that never got old. Do you think you could do something like that?"</p>

            <p>Nine months later, with the help of Claude, I can say yes.</p>

            <p>Sorting History is the game my wife asked for. New categories every month. Fresh content that keeps growing. The timeline mechanic she loves, on our devices, whenever we want to play.</p>
