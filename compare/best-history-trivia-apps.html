            <h2>1. Sorting History</h2>
            <p><strong>Best for:</strong> History enthusiasts who want to actually learn timelines, not just answer A/B/C/D.</p>

            <h3>What makes it different</h3>
            <p>Sorting History is the only app on this list where you arrange events in chronological order instead of answering multiple choice questions. You see historical events, you drag them into the correct timeline. It's a fundamentally different game mechanic that tests (and teaches) your understanding of how history fits together.</p>

            <h3>Strengths</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Deep history content:</strong> 12 dedicated categories at launch (US History, World Wars, Ancient Civilizations, European History, Scientific Discoveries, and more). 100+ researched events per category. 1,200+ events total.</li>
                <li><strong>You learn even when you're wrong:</strong> After each round, you see the full correct timeline with dates and context. Every game is a mini history lesson.</li>
                <li><strong>No timer:</strong> Take your time. Think it through. History rewards knowledge, not speed.</li>
                <li><strong>Two game modes:</strong> Sorting History (arrange events in order) and History Pinpoint (guess the exact year).</li>
                <li><strong>Three difficulty levels:</strong> Friendly (no penalties), Competitive, Expert.</li>
                <li><strong>Local multiplayer:</strong> Pass & Play (2-6 teams, one device) and Network Play (two devices, same WiFi).</li>
                <li><strong>Works offline:</strong> Everything is stored locally. Play on a plane.</li>
                <li><strong>4 languages:</strong> English, German, Portuguese, Dutch.</li>
                <li><strong>Community votes on new content:</strong> Two new categories added monthly. You vote on what's next.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Limitations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>History only. If you want science, sports, or pop culture trivia, look elsewhere.</li>
                <li>No online matchmaking. Multiplayer is local only.</li>
                <li>4 languages (not 25 like Trivia Crack).</li>
                <li>New app. Smaller community than established games.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Price:</strong> Free (8 categories, 800+ events). Explorer: $1.99/mo or $9.99/yr. Historian: $2.99/mo or $14.99/yr. Lifetime options available.</p>

            <h3>Limitations</h3>
