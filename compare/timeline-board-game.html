        <p class="page-intro">Looking for a digital version of the Timeline card game? Here's how Sorting History compares to the beloved tabletop classic.</p>

        <section id="what-is-timeline">
            <h2>What Is the Timeline Board Game?</h2>
            <p>Timeline is a card game published by Asmodee where players place historical events in chronological order. Each card shows an event on one side and the date on the other. Players take turns adding cards to a growing timeline, winning when they successfully place all their cards.</p>
            <p>It's a fantastic game. We've played it for years. But it has some limitations that a digital version can solve.</p>

            <h2>What We Love About Timeline</h2>
            <p>Timeline gets a lot right. The core mechanic is brilliant:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Simple to learn, hard to master.</strong> Anyone can play within minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Educational without being boring.</strong> You learn by playing, not by reading.</li>
                <li><strong>Great for groups.</strong> Works with 2-8 players of any age.</li>
                <li><strong>Physical cards are satisfying.</strong> There's something nice about holding real cards.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We built Sorting History because we love this mechanic and wanted it to go further.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="timeline-limitations">
            <h2>Where Timeline Falls Short</h2>
            <p>After years of playing Timeline, we noticed some recurring frustrations:</p>

            <article>
                <h3>"We've memorized all the cards"</h3>
                <p>With ~100 events per box, experienced players start recognizing cards and remembering dates. The game loses its challenge.</p>
                <p><strong>Sorting History:</strong> 2,500+ events across up to 30 categories (growing monthly from 12 at launch). You won't run out.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>"We need more categories"</h3>
                <p>Each Timeline box covers a narrow theme. Want more variety? Buy more boxes. Want to mix themes? Shuffle multiple decks together.</p>
                <p><strong>Sorting History:</strong> Up to 12 categories at launch (8 free, more with subscriptions), growing to 30. From Ancient Civilizations to TV History. Mix and match any combination for each game.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>"We can't play remotely"</h3>
                <p>Timeline requires physical cards in person. Can't play with family across town or friends across the country.</p>
                <p><strong>Sorting History:</strong> Network Play connects devices over local WiFi. Pass & Play works on one device. (Online play across the internet is on our roadmap.)</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>"The cards are showing wear"</h3>
                <p>Bent corners, coffee stains, and — worst of all — faint date imprints visible through the card backs.</p>
                <p><strong>Sorting History:</strong> Digital means no wear, no damage, no cheating by recognizing card backs.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>"It's too hard / too easy"</h3>
                <p>Timeline has fixed rules. Great for some groups, frustrating for others.</p>
                <p><strong>Sorting History:</strong> Three scoring modes. Friendly (no penalties) for learning. Competitive (+2/-1) for balanced play. Expert (+3/-2) for serious history buffs.</p>
            </article>
        </section>

        <section id="what-timeline-does-better">
            <h2>What Timeline Still Does Better</h2>
            <p>We're honest about where the physical game wins:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tactile experience.</strong> Physical cards feel good. Nothing digital fully replaces that.</li>
                <li><strong>No screens at the table.</strong> Some families prefer screen-free game nights.</li>
                <li><strong>Gift-worthy packaging.</strong> A Timeline box makes a great gift. An app download... less so.</li>
                <li><strong>No subscriptions required.</strong> Buy once, play forever. (Though Sorting History has a free tier and lifetime purchase option.)</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Which Should You Choose?</h2>

            <article>
                <h3>Choose Timeline if:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You prefer physical cards and screen-free game nights</li>
                    <li>You're buying a gift that feels tangible</li>
                    <li>You play occasionally and don't need endless content</li>
                    <li>You already own and love the physical game</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>You've memorized your Timeline cards and want fresh content</li>
                    <li>You want more categories (up to 12 at launch, growing to 30) instead of 4-6</li>
                    <li>You want to play solo or with people on separate devices</li>
                    <li>You want difficulty options for different skill levels</li>
                    <li>You want to try before you buy (free tier available)</li>
                    <li>You're tired of carrying cards everywhere</li>
