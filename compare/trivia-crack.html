            <h2>They're Different Games for Different People</h2>
            <p>This isn't really a "which is better" comparison. Trivia Crack and Sorting History do fundamentally different things.</p>

            <article>
                <h3>Trivia Crack is a mile wide</h3>
                <p>It covers everything: science, sports, entertainment, geography, art, and history. If you want variety across topics and enjoy competing with random opponents online, Trivia Crack is excellent at that. It's a social game first, a learning tool second.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>Sorting History is a mile deep</h3>
                <p>It does one thing: history. But it does it with 12 dedicated categories, 100+ researched events per category, and a game mechanic that teaches you the actual timeline. You don't pick A/B/C/D and hope for the best. You arrange events in order. You have to actually think about whether the printing press came before or after the fall of Constantinople.</p>

            <h2>Why History Fans Switch to Sorting History</h2>

            <article>
                <h3>"Multiple choice doesn't teach me anything"</h3>
                <p>In Trivia Crack, you pick from four options. If you don't know, you guess. If you guess right, you move on having learned nothing. In Sorting History, you build a timeline. Even when you're wrong, you see the correct order with dates and context. Every round is a mini history lesson.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>"History is just one of six categories"</h3>
                <p>In Trivia Crack, you might get 2-3 history questions in a game. The rest is sports, entertainment, and geography. Sorting History is 100% history, all the time. US History, World Wars, Ancient Civilizations, Scientific Discoveries, European History, and more.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>"I don't want a timer"</h3>
                <p>Trivia Crack's timed format rewards quick recall. Sorting History has no timer at all. Think about it. Look at the events. Reason through the timeline. History rewards knowledge, not speed.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>"I want to play offline"</h3>
                <p>Trivia Crack needs an internet connection for most features. Sorting History works completely offline. All your categories and events are stored locally on your device. Play on a plane, on a train, or anywhere without signal.</p>
