# Story MKT-002.1: Capture App Screenshots for Website

## Summary
Capture all required in-app screenshots for the marketing website and place them in the correct directory with proper naming.

## Parent Epic
MKT-002: Website Visual Assets

## Dependencies
- Simulator must be running with the app installed
- User must manually navigate to each screen (deep-link automation is blocked by system dialog)

## Context
The marketing website needs real in-app screenshots to show prospective users what the game looks like. One screenshot (home menu) was already captured. The remaining screens need manual navigation in the simulator because `xcrun simctl openurl` triggers a confirmation dialog that can't be automated.

## Screenshot Inventory

### Already Captured
| Screen | File | Status |
|--------|------|--------|
| Home Menu | `images/screenshots/home-menu-clean.png` | DONE |

### Still Needed
| Screen | File Name | How to Navigate | What It Shows |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Game Setup | `game-setup.png` | Tap "Solo Adventure" | Difficulty slider, game length, category picker |
| Category Picker | `categories.png` | Tap "Solo Adventure" > tap category selector | Grid of 8-12 category tiles |
| Gameplay | `gameplay-timeline.png` | Start a game, play one round | The timeline sorting mechanic in action |
| Results | `results-screen.png` | Finish a game | Score breakdown, ranking, accuracy |

## Output Directory
```
/Users/raufglasgow/AI Projects/Trivia Game/SortingHistory-website/website/images/screenshots/
```

## Capture Command
Once the user has navigated to the correct screen in the simulator:
```bash
xcrun simctl io booted screenshot "<output_directory>/<filename>.png"
```

Use `booted` (not a hardcoded device UUID) so it works on any machine.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All 4 screenshots listed above are captured and saved to the output directory
2. Screenshots are clean — no debug overlays, no system alerts visible
3. Screenshots are from a device with a notch or Dynamic Island (modern iPhone look)
4. Each screenshot clearly shows the described UI state
5. Images are reasonable file size for web use

## Process
1. Confirm simulator is booted with app installed
2. Ask user to navigate to each screen
3. Capture screenshot after user confirms they're on the right screen
4. Verify each screenshot file exists and is non-empty
5. Report which screenshots were captured successfully

## Estimate
15 minutes (depends on user navigation speed)

## Notes
- NEVER launch the simulator or Xcode without user permission
- NEVER use hardcoded simulator device names — use `booted` or dynamic discovery
- If the app isn't installed, the user must build and install it first
