                <h2>Not Your Typical Trivia Game</h2>
                <p><strong>Tired of picking A, B, C, or D?</strong> Sorting History uses a timeline mechanic where you drag historical events into chronological order. It's more engaging, more challenging, and you actually learn something.</p>
                <p>Each round shows you a timeline and asks you to place a new event. Get it right, and your timeline grows. Get it wrong, and you learn the correct placement. Either way, you walk away knowing more than when you started.</p>
