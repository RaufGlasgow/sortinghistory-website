        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 5, 2026</p>

        <p>
            Sorting History ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy.
            This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when
            you use our iOS application.
        </p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>Information You Provide</h3>
        <p>
            Sorting History is designed to be privacy-friendly. We collect minimal information:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bug Reports:</strong> If you choose to submit a bug report, we collect the information you provide (description of the issue) along with basic device information (device model, iOS version, app version) to help us diagnose and fix problems.</li>
            <li><strong>Email Address:</strong> Only if you voluntarily provide it when submitting a bug report or contacting support.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Information We Do NOT Collect</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not collect your name, location, or personal identifiers</li>
            <li>We do not track your gameplay or create user profiles</li>
            <li>We do not use third-party analytics or advertising SDKs</li>
            <li>We do not sell or share your data with third parties</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
        <p>
            All game progress, scores, and preferences are stored locally on your device.
            This data is not transmitted to our servers. If you delete the app, this data
            is permanently removed from your device.
        </p>

        <h2>Network Features</h2>
        <p>
            Sorting History includes local network multiplayer features (Team Battle and Network Play).
            These features use Apple's local networking frameworks to connect devices on the same
            Wi-Fi network. No game data is transmitted over the internet during local multiplayer sessions.
        </p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Sorting History is designed to be family-friendly and educational. We do not knowingly
            collect personal information from children under 13. The app does not require account
            creation, and all gameplay data remains on the device.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal information
            to us through a bug report, please contact us at
            <a href="mailto:privacy@sortinghistory.com">privacy@sortinghistory.com</a>
            and we will delete that information.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            We implement appropriate technical measures to protect any information you provide.
            Bug reports are transmitted securely and stored in private systems with limited access.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            Sorting History does not integrate third-party analytics, advertising networks, or
            social media SDKs. The app may be distributed through the Apple App Store, which has
            its own privacy policy available at
            <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apple.com/legal/privacy</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Request deletion of any bug report data you've submitted</li>
            <li>Request information about what data we have associated with your email address</li>
            <li>Opt out of communications by contacting us</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes
            by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.
