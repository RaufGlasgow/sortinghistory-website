        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>How do I play Sorting History?</h3>
        <p>
            In Sorting History, you're presented with historical events and must arrange them in
            chronological order. Tap and drag events to sort them from earliest to most recent.
            The fewer moves you make and the faster you complete the sort, the higher your score!
        </p>

        <h3>What game modes are available?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Solo Adventure:</strong> Play alone and test your knowledge across various history categories.</li>
            <li><strong>Pass & Play:</strong> Challenge friends by passing the device. Take turns sorting events and see who can achieve the best score.</li>
            <li><strong>Network Play:</strong> Connect multiple iPhones and iPads on the same Wi-Fi network for team competitions. Perfect for classrooms and parties!</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Is my progress saved?</h3>
        <p>
            Yes! Your game progress and scores are automatically saved on your device. Your data
            stays private and is not uploaded to any servers.
        </p>

        <h3>Does the app work offline?</h3>
        <p>
            Yes! Solo Adventure and local Pass & Play modes work completely offline. Network Play
            requires a local Wi-Fi connection to other devices, but does not require internet access.
        </p>

        <h3>Is Sorting History free?</h3>
        <p>
            Sorting History offers three tiers to fit your needs:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Free (Ad-Supported):</strong> Play 8 categories at no cost. You will see occasional ads between games.</li>
            <li><strong>Explorer:</strong> 10 categories at launch, no ads. Available as a monthly subscription, annual subscription, or one-time lifetime purchase.</li>
            <li><strong>Historian:</strong> 12 categories at launch, no ads, and first access to every new category. Available as a monthly subscription, annual subscription, or one-time lifetime purchase.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            New categories are released every month. Historian subscribers get them first, Explorer subscribers receive them one month later, and free players one month after that. Every tier grows over time.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I manage my subscription?</h3>
        <p>
            You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time through your device:
            <strong>iOS Settings > [Your Name] > Subscriptions > Sorting History</strong>.
            Subscriptions auto-renew unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I restore purchases?</h3>
        <p>
            If you reinstalled the app or switched devices, your subscription or lifetime purchase can be restored automatically.
            Open the app, go to Settings, and tap "Restore Purchases." Your subscription status is tied to your Apple ID and will sync across all your devices.
        </p>

        <h3>What is the content cascade?</h3>
        <p>
            The content cascade is how new categories roll out each month across tiers:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Historian</strong> receives new categories first.</li>
            <li><strong>Explorer</strong> receives those same categories one month later.</li>
            <li><strong>Free</strong> receives them one month after Explorer.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This means every tier gets new content over time — Historian subscribers simply get it earliest.
        </p>

        <h3>What age is this game appropriate for?</h3>
        <p>
            Sorting History is designed to be family-friendly and educational. The content is
            suitable for all ages, though younger players may need help with some of the more
            challenging historical events.
        </p>

        <h3>I found an error in the historical content</h3>
        <p>
