        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>How do I play Sorting History?</h3>
        <p>
            In Sorting History, you're presented with historical events and must arrange them in
            chronological order. Tap and drag events to sort them from earliest to most recent.
            The fewer moves you make and the faster you complete the sort, the higher your score!
        </p>

        <h3>What game modes are available?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Solo Adventure:</strong> Play alone and test your knowledge across various history categories.</li>
            <li><strong>Team Battle:</strong> Challenge friends by passing the device. Take turns sorting events and see who can achieve the best score.</li>
            <li><strong>Network Play:</strong> Connect multiple iPads on the same Wi-Fi network for team competitions. Perfect for classrooms and parties!</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Is my progress saved?</h3>
        <p>
            Yes! Your game progress and scores are automatically saved on your device. Your data
            stays private and is not uploaded to any servers.
        </p>

        <h3>Does the app work offline?</h3>
        <p>
            Yes! Solo Adventure and local Team Battle modes work completely offline. Network Play
            requires a local Wi-Fi connection to other devices, but does not require internet access.
        </p>

        <h3>Is Sorting History free?</h3>
        <p>
            Sorting History is free to download with core content included. Additional expansion
            packs with more historical events may be available as optional purchases.
        </p>

        <h3>What age is this game appropriate for?</h3>
        <p>
            Sorting History is designed to be family-friendly and educational. The content is
            suitable for all ages, though younger players may need help with some of the more
            challenging historical events.
        </p>
